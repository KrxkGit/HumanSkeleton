April Fool's Day is an interesting holiday, this HumanSkeleton is made for the April Fool's Day. We can use HumanSkeleton to change the background of desktop, as well as changing the position of each icon on desktop randomly and continuously. What's more, user need to enter the correct password to quit the application. HumanSkeleton uses the Hook technology to inject the process which masters the Desktop. At the same time, it edits the registry to implement running the application by the windows system. And it is worth noting that HumanSekleton uses the KeepRunning process to avoid being killed by the task manager, when it is killed, it can be restarted by the KeepRunning process.
